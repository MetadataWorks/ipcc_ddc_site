 <p>Future climate in world regions: an intercomparison of model-based projections for the new
 IPCC emissions scenarios</p>
 
 <p><b>Background (Please read this first)</b></font></p>
 
 <p>This report was prepared at the request of the Task Group on Scenarios for Climate Impact
 Assessment (TGCIA)<sup>(<a href="#ftnote1">1</a>)</sup> and constitutes IPCC Supporting Material<sup>(<a href="#ftnote2">2</a>)</sup>. It was reviewed by members of the
 Task Group and outside experts, made available at this site as a PDF file, and subsequently published
 by the Finnish Environment Institute.</p>
 
 <p>The scatter diagrams described and presented on these pages depict projected changes in seasonal
 surface air temperature and precipitation for three 30-year periods (2010-2039, 2040-2069 and
 2070-2099) relative to the baseline period 1961-1990 in 32 sub-continental scale regions
 (see below).</p>

 <p>The climate changes have been simulated by seven coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation
 models (AOGCMs; see Table 1 of the accompanying report), the greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing
 being inferred from the SRES emission scenarios A1FI, A2, B1 and B2. Responses to the A2 and B2
 scenarios are based on AOGCM simulations; projections for other scenarios were mainly derived from
 available runs applying a pattern-scaling technique (for a description of the technique and its
 applicability, see section 3.2 of the report). As we have dealt with 32 regions, three projection
 periods and four seasons, there are 384 scatter diagrams altogether.</p>
 
 <p>The scatter diagrams are designed to offer guidance to impacts analysts who wish to assess the
 likely range of future climate change in a region. The diagrams can be used to define the limits of
 temperature/ precipitation change to be employed in climate impact sensitivity studies. They may
 also assist in the selection of a representative set of model-based projections to be employed
 as scenarios. However, it is recommended that further study of the coupled-GCM outputs be
 undertaken to establish their suitability for application in regional impact studies, preferably
 in co-operation with experienced climatologists.</p>
 
 <p>For example, one possible criterion for judging model suitability is its skill at reproducing
 present-day observed climate (see section 2 of the accompanying report). Confidence in a model is
 enhanced further if the model is able to capture regional phenomena such as the Asian monsoon,
 the El Ni&ntilde;o &#150; Southern Oscillation and seasonal ice and snowcover, which are important
 for many impact applications. Nevertheless, model performance varies widely at regional scale,
 and it should be remembered that a model that performs well in one region or for one variable
 might perform less well in another region or for a different variable. Moreover, even though a
 good simulation of present-day regional climate is an encouraging result, it is still no guarantee
 of reliable projections of climate change. General information on the performance of coupled-GCMs,
 including the seven models used in this exercise can be found in the report (see below).</p>
