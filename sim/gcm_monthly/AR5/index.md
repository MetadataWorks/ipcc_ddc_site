<h1 align="CENTER">AR5 GCM data</h1>
</div>
<p>Climate model results provide the basis for important components of IPCC assessments, including the understanding of climate change and the projections of future climate change and related impacts. The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) relies heavily on the <a target="_blank" href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5">Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5)</a>, a collaborative climate modelling process coordinated by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wcrp-climate.org/">World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)</a>.</p>

<p>The CMIP5 archive has evolved through and beyond the IPCC 5th Assessment process, with modelling groups eager to contribute their best available data to the research community. 
The IPCC DDC provides access to two snapshots of the CMIP5 archive in the World Data Center Climate (WDCC):
<big><strong><ul>
<li><a target="_blank" title="IPCC WGI AR5 snapshot" class="internal-link" href="WG1-Archive.html">(i) the IPCC Working Group I snapshot, and</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" title="DDC AR5 Reference snapshot" class="internal-link" href="Reference-Archive.html">(ii) the DDC Reference snapshot.</a></li>
</ul></strong></big>

<p>The IPCC WGI snapshot was collected at ETH Zurich to support the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.climatechange2013.org">IPCC WGI AR5</a> assessment process, including the production of CMIP5-based figures in the WGI AR5 report. This dataset is a subset of the data in the CMIP5 archive on March 15, 2013 (the cutoff date for literature to be included in the WGI AR5 report). A selected subset of this data can be ordered on storage media, details are given <a href="/sim/gcm_monthly/INFO/dvd_data.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The DDC Reference snapshot was collected by the <a target="_blank" href="http://wdc-climate.de/">World Data Center Climate (WDCC) at the DKRZ in Germany</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/">British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) in the UK</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://pcmdi.llnl.gov/">Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) University of California in the US</a>. The DDC Reference snapshot is more extensive than the WGI snapshot: It contains data that was discussed in the scientific literature and thus contributed indirectly to the IPCC 5th Assessment Report. The reference snapshot is also based on the status of the CMIP5 data archive as of March 15, 2013.<a href="#footnote-ESGF-data"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The Fact Sheet on <a target="_blank" class="internal-link" href="../../../docs/factsheets/TGICA_Fact_Sheet_CMIP5_data_provided_at_the_IPCC_DDC_Ver_1_2016.pdf">CMIP5 data provided at the IPCC Data Distribution Centre</a> gives additional information on these two data snapshots. CMIP5 data provided at the IPCC Data Distribution Centre (Published September 2016) CMIP5 data provided through the IPCC DDC has undergone a <a target="_blank" href="http://cmip5qc.wdc-climate.de">quality control procedure</a>. To find individual information on data, data creation and data quality for an experiment, please follow the links in the tables on the two data access pages above.</p>

<p>As noted above, the CMIP5 archive is evolving and in some cases the data used in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report may have been superseded. Latest versions for all experiments are available in the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) at <a target="_blank" href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/data-portal.html">https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/data-portal.html</a>. For corrections of data sets published under later versions please look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/errata.html">errata page</a> hosted by PCMDI.</p>

<!-- <p>The data underlying the IPCC - Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) were created and collected within CMIP5 (<a target="_blank" href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/">Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5</a>). CMIP5 data are collected, managed and disseminated by ESGF (<a target="_blank" href="http://esgf.org/">Earth System Grid Federation</a>). The IPCC DDC accumulates CMIP5 reference data that have likely been used in the IPCC AR5 while ESGF continues to provide the most recent versions of CMIP5 data. 
</p>
<p>The IPCC DDC provides access to long-term archived CMIP5 data in the WDCC (World Data Center Climate). IPCC AR5 climate model data are in particular the CMIP5 Data Archive of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.climatechange2013.org">IPCC Working Group I</a> and the CMIP5 Reference Data Archive. The CMIP5 Data Archive of IPCC WG-I was collected at the ETH Zurich parallel to the writing process of the IPCC WG-I report. The CMIP5 reference data were collected by the <a target="_blank" href="http://wdc-climate.de/">WDCC at DKRZ in Germany</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/">BADC in the UK</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/">PCMDI in the US</a>. For the IPCC AR5 data archives the status of the CMIP5 ESGF data archive around March 15, 2013 was chosen because this was the deadline for literature contributions to be accepted in the WG-I report. CMIP5 data, which were published in ESGF before March 15, 2013 might underlie the WG-I report, data published later certainly not.
</p>

<p>The IPCC AR5 climate model data of the two data archives are provided on two separate pages. The CMIP5 Data Archive of IPCC WG-I is a subset of the CMIP5 Reference Data Archive:</p>
<big><strong><ul>
<li><a target="_blank" title="CMIP5 Data Archive of IPCC WG-I" class="internal-link" href="WG1-Archive.html">CMIP5 Data Archive of IPCC WG-I</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" title="CMIP5 Reference Data Archive" class="internal-link" href="Reference-Archive.html">CMIP5 Reference Data Archive</a></li>
</ul></strong></big>

<p>
Data moved into the IPCC DDC had undergone a <a target="_blank" href="http://cmip5qc.wdc-climate.de">quality control procedure</a>. Please have a look at the individual information on data, data creation and data quality for an experiment by following the links in the tables on the pages for the CMIP5 Data Archive of IPCC WG-I and the CMIP5 Reference Data Archive. 
Latest versions for all experiments are available in the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) at <a target="_blank" href="http://esgf-node.llnl.gov/">http://esgf-node.llnl.gov/</a>.
