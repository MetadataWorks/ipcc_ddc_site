<p>
 One of the main goals of the Data Distribution Centre was to make available to the impacts
 community a set of recent GCM outputs that both reflect the state-of-the-art of model experiments
 and provide a representative range of results from different GCMs. To this end, the IPCC TGCIA
 defined a set of criteria that were applied to identify a small number of GCM experiments whose
 results could be deposited at the IPCC DDC. Models should:
</p>
 <table>
 <tr><td>
 <UL>
 <li>be full 3D coupled ocean-atmospheric GCMs,</li>
 <li>be documented in the peer reviewed literature,</li>
 <li>have performed a multi-century control run (for stability reasons)and</li>
 <li>have participated in CMIP2 (Second Coupled Model Intercomparison Project).</li>
 </UL>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 <p>
 In addition,the models preferably should:
 <UL>
 <li>have performed a 2 x CO2 mixed layer run,</li>
 <li>have participated in AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project)</li>
 <li>have a resolution of at least T40, R30 or 3&ordm; latitude x 3&ordm; longitude</li>
 <li>consider explicit greenhouse gases (e.g. CO2, CH4, etc.)</li>
 </UL>
 </p>
 
<p>
 On the basis of these criteria, results of experiments at seven modelling centres are
 currently held by the DDC, with the possibility of others being added later if
 they too qualify for inclusion.</p>
