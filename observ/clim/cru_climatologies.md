 <p> The CRU Global Climate Dataset, available through the IPCC DDC, consists of a multi-variate 0.5&ordm;
 latitude by 0.5&ordm; longitude resolution mean monthly climatology for global land areas, excluding
 Antarctica. Together with a mean climatology, which is strictly constrained to the period 1961-1990,
 there is a monthly time series at the same resolution for the period 1901-2000. The mean 1961-1990
 climatology comprises a suite of eleven surface variables: precipitation (PRE) and wet-day frequency
 (WET); mean, maximum and minimum temperature (TMP, TMX, TMN); vapour pressure (VAP) and relative
 humidity (REH); sunshine percent (SUN) and cloud cover (CLD); frost frequency (FRS); and wind
 speed (WND). The time series component comprises all variables except sunshine per cent, frost
 frequency and wind speed. These are still under development.</p>
 
 <p><b>The mean 1961-90 climatology</b></p>
 <p> The mean climate surfaces have been constructed from a new dataset of station 1961-1990
 climatological normals, numbering between 19,800 (precipitation) and 3615 (windspeed).
 The station data were interpolated as a function of latitude, longitude and elevation using
 thin-plate splines. The accuracy of the interpolations were assessed using cross-validation
 and by comparison with other climatologies (New et al., 1999).</p>
 
 <p><b>The anomaly timeseries</b></p>
 <p> The anomaly time series were constructed using historic anomalies derived from the monthly
 data holdings of the <a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk">Climatic Research Unit (CRU)</a> and
 the <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcnm/">Global Historic
 Climatology Network (GHCN)</a>. For the purposes of developing monthly gridded time series,
 the variables were classified as either primary or secondary. For the primary variables -
 PRE, TMP, TMX, TMN - sufficient data were available to enable interpolation directly from
 the station time series. In the case of secondary variables - CLD, VAP, REH, WET - the available
 station time series were sparsely sampled in space and time. These variables had to be derived
 indirectly from gridded time series of primary variables. Station data that were available
 for secondary variables were used to develop relationships to the primary variables, and to
 validate the derived gridded time series.</p>
 
 <p><b>The full global climate dataset</b></p>
 <p> To calculate monthly time series, grids of monthly anomalies relative to 1961-90 were
 calculated for each variable and applied to their respective 1961-90 climatology. The anomaly
 approach was adopted because the network of station normals was much more comprehensive than the
 network of station time series. The spatial variability in mean climate was best captured by the
 denser network of station normals, while the more sparse network of primary variable time series
 captured as much temporal variability as possible.</p>
 
 <p><b>Viewing and availability</b></p>
