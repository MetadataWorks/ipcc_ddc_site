  <h2> Creation  of the IPCC Data Distribution Centre</h2>

  <p>   The DDC has been established to facilitate the timely distribution of a consistent set of
  up-to-date scenarios of changes in climate and related environmental and socio-economic factors for
  use in climate impacts assessments. The intention is that these new assessments can feed into the
  review process of the IPCC.</p>

  <p>   The initiative to establish a DDC grew out of a recommendation by the
  <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/activities/tgica.shtml" target="new">
  IPCC Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Analysis (TGICA)</a>.
  This Task Group was itself formed following a recommendation made at the IPCC Workshop on
  Regional Climate Change Projections for Impact Assessment (London, 24-26 September 1996). </p>

  <p>   The establishment of the DDC was approved by the IPCC Bureau at its Thirteenth session
  (9-11 July 1997) and it was subsequently determined at the XIIIth IPCC Plenary (Maldives, 22-28
  September 1997) that the DDC would be a shared operation between the
  <a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk" target="new">Climatic Research Unit (CRU)</a> in the
  United Kingdom and the Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ) in Germany. In 2003 a third centre,
  the <a href="http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/" target="new">Center for International Earth Science
  Information Network (CIESIN)</a> in the USA, joined the DDC collaboration.
  From February 1st, 2007 <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk" target="new">British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC)</a>
  has replaced CRU as the United Kingdom partner.</p>

  <h2> TGICA Mandate and DDC Governance</h2>

  <p>The conduct of TGICA is governed by its
  <a href="/docs/TGICA_Mandate_031207.htm">mandate</a>, which
  can be downloaded here as <a href="/docs/TGICA_Mandate_031207.pdf">an Adbobe pdf document</a>.
  The TGICA has established a set of procedures for
  managing content on the DDC as described in the
  <a href="/docs/TGICA_DDC_Governance_2012feb08.html">DDC Governance document</a>, which
  can be downloaded here as <a href="/docs/TGICA_DDC_Governance_2012feb08.pdf">an Adbobe pdf document</a>.
