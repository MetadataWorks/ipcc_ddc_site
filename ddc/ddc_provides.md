  <h2>Data collections</h2>
 
  <p> The DDC provides five main types of data and guidance, which meet certain
  criteria laid down by  the TGICA.  They are introduced
  briefly here and described in more detail throughout the web site and
  accompanying <a href="/guidelines/index.html">guidelines</a>: </p>
  
  <h3>1. Climate estimates from observations</h3>
  <a href="/observ/clim/index.html">The climate datasets</a> comprise 1961-1990 mean monthly data over global land
  areas for nine variables on a 0.5&ordm; latitude/longitude grid, together with decadal
  anomalies from this mean for the period 1901-1995. This data set is currently being updated
  to 2000 and interpolated to a finer resolution (10 x 10 arc minutes). Pointers are provided
  to other relevant global climatologies.
  <br/><br/>
  
  <h3>2. Global climate model data</h3>
  Global climate model data is available as <a href="/sim/gcm_monthly/">
  at a range of frequencies</a> or as 
  <a href="/sim/gcm_clim/">climatologies</a>.
  Data is held for climate model projections used as input to the Second, Third, Fourth  and Fifth IPCC Assessment Reports.
  Full details of the variables held can be found on the relevant data pages.
  
  The climatologies of climate model projections can also be viewed through the 
  <a href="/maps/">DDC visualisation service</a>.
  <br/>
  
  Daily fields for earlier Assessment Reports are not provided by the DDC; for the 4th Assessment Report they are available from the CMIP3 archive at <a class="extern" href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov">PCMDI</a> (though some data in the CMIP3 archive was added after the 4th Assement Report).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  
  <h3>3. Socio-economic data and scenarios</h3>
  <a href="http://sedac.ipcc-data.org/ddc/index.html"> Socio-economic data and scenarios</a>
 are important for characterizing the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of social and economic systems in relation
to global and regional climate change. The DDC provides access to baseline and scenario data related to population, economic development, technology and natural resources for use in climate impact assessments. The <a href="http://sedac.ipcc-data.org/ddc/index.html">reference data</a> include country and regional level indicators of socio-economic and resource variables. The scenario data supplied extend to 2100 and are based on the assumptions underlying the set of emissions scenarios developed for the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, <a href="http://sedac.ipcc-data.org/ddc/sres/index.html">SRES</a> in 2000, as well as the
<a href="http://sedac.ipcc-data.org/ddc/is92/index.html">six IS92 emissions scenarios</a> prepared by the IPCC in 1992. 

  <br/><br/>
  
  <h3>4. Data and scenarios for other environmental changes</h3>
  Some <a href="/observ/ddc_envdata.html">data and information for other environmental changes</a> is also included in
  the site.
  These include data on global mean CO2 concentration, global and regional sea-level rise,
  regional ground-level ozone concentration, sulphate aerosol concentration and sulphur
  deposition. All of these scenarios were developed for the IPCC Third Assessment Report based on
  the SRES emissions scenarios. Detailed documentation and guidance is also provided for the use
  of these data.
  
<h3>5. Linked data resources</h3>

The DDC also provides links to datasets which have been reviewed and pass a set of
<a href="/documents/ddcLinkingCriteria.pdf">linking criteriea.</a>
