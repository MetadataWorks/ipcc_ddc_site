 <b> The New Visualisation Application is <a href="/maps/"> Available Here </a></b>
 <br><br>
 <img src="/img/vis_descrip_02.png">
 
 <p>The new visualisation application is available to unify
 viewing of Climate Observation and GCM scenario data and to provide publication
 quality downloadable plots.
 We aim to support the use of this visualisation on the
 following browsers: Firefox 1.5+, IE 6.0+, Safari 1.0+ and Opera 9+,
 though we do not have facilities to test all these, so cannot make
 any guarantees.
 For browsers not on this list we cannot, unfortunately, provide the interactive graphics, but all the data
 can be accessed from the <a href="/sim/">data pages</a>. If you encounter a problem while using one of
 the browsers we try to support, please let us know <a href="/cgi-bin/query">here</a>.

 <p><b><a name="old">Previous Visualisation Options</a></b></p>
 
 <p>
 There are five visualisation options to choose from at which are listed below. 
 The visualisation software allows you to plot your own customised fields. 
 There are also download and print options which
 allow you to save your data and plot any fields that you produce.
 </p>
 
 
 <p><b>BASELINE CLIMATE DATA:</b></p>
 
 <p><b><a href="http://apps.ipcc-data.org/java/visualisation.html">View observed fields</a></b></p>
 
 <p>This option allows you to view global maps of observed surface climate variables over land areas
 for 1961-90 and other periods, and also to examine the differences between observed and modelled
 1961-90 mean fields.</p>
 
 <p><b><a href="http://apps.ipcc-data.org/java/time_series.html">View observed regional time series</a></b></p>
 
 <p>This option allows you to plot observed climate timeseries for the period 1901-1995 for a user-defined
 region of the global land surface, and for a selection of variables and months or seasons.</p>
 
 <p><b>IPCC SRES SCENARIOS:</b></p>
 
 <p><b>View Global Time-series</b></p>
 
 <p>This option allows you to view observed and modelled global/hemispheric-mean
 temperature and  precipitation series for the DDC Models.</p>
 <p><b><a href="http://apps.ipcc-data.org/cgi-bin/ddcvis/gcmcf">View SRES GCM change fields</a></b></p>
 <p>This option allows you to examine any of the various GCM change fields for any of the three
 30-year future timeslices and also to examine the difference between two user-defined GCM change
 fields, whether different GCMs, ensemble members or different timeslices.</p>
 
 <p><b>View Observed and GCM fields combined - Under Construction</b></p>
 <p>This option allows you to combine the observed 1961-90 global land fields with a user-defined
 GCM change field to generate a future climate filed for any timeslice and variable.</p>
 
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p><b>IPCC IS92 SCENARIOS:</b></p>
 
 <p><b>View Global Time-series - Under Construction</b></p>
 
 <p>This option allows you to view observed and modelled global/hemispheric-mean
 temperature and  precipitation series for the DDC Models.</p>
 
 <p><b><a href="http://apps.ipcc-data.org/java/gcm.html">View GCM change fields</a></b></p>
 
 <p>This option allows you to examine any of the various GCM change fields for any of the three
 30-year future timeslices and also to examine the difference between two user-defined GCM change
 fields, whether different GCMs, ensemble members or different timeslices.</p>
 
 <p><b><a href="http://apps.ipcc-data.org/java/obs_plus_gcm.html">View Observed and GCM fields
 combined</a></b></p>
 
 <p>This option allows you to combine the observed 1961-90 global land fields with a user-defined
 GCM change field to generate a future climate field for any timeslice and variable.</p>
