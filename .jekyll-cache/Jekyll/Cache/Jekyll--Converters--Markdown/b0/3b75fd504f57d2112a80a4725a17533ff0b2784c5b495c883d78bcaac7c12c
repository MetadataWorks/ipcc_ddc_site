 <p> The DDC has been established by the IPCC to provide a common and easily accessible set of
 information relating to climate change scenarios for impacts and adaptation assessments.
 As well as providing direct access to GCM data through the <a href="/sim/index.html">DDC GCM Data Archive</a>, the DDC also provides users with access to a variety of other
 scenario information and descriptions of these various datasets and how they can be used in
 scenario construction and impacts assessment.</p>
 
 <p> Users often have questions about what different scenario datasets represent and how they
 can be used in scenario construction and application. We have provided answers to a set of
 the most <a href="/ddc/ddc_faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</a>. Although these answers
 cannot be exhaustive they provide some assistance to users who may be new to climate scenario issues.
 A more structured guide to the DDC scenarios is provided in the <a href="guidelines/index.html">DDC
 Guidelines Section</a>.</p>
 
 <p> Finally, if you have any questions about the DDC, find errors on the site, or have general
 questions about climate scenarios that we can add to our FAQs, then please contact the <a href="https://metadata.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/6">helpdesk</a></p>
