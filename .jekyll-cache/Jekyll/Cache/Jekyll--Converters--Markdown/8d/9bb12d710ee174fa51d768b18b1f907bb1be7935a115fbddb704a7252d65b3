<p><b>Background Information</b></p>

<p>The NCAR model version used here is the NCAR-DoE global coupled
 model (sometimes referred to as the Washington-Meehl coupled model.
 Submissions to the DDC using the later NCAR CSM and PCM models
 will follow). Simulations of 20th century climate and projections
 of climate into the 21st century were conducted with a global
 coupled climate model without flux adjustment (these experiments
 are described in Meehl <i>et al.</i> (1999). The global coupled
 climate model used in these experiments has an atmospheric component
 with <a href="ncardoe_landsea.html">rhomboidal 15 (R15) resolution
 (roughly 4.5&ordm; latitude by 7.5&ordm; longitude)
 </a>with 9 levels, mass flux convection and a
 cloud albedo feedback scheme; a global 1&ordm; by 1&ordm; 20-level
 ocean; and dynamic and thermodynamic sea ice (Meehl and Washington,
 1995; Washington and Meehl, 1996). Characteristics of this model
 are described by:</p>

 <li>Meehl and Washington (1995) for sensitivity aspects of the
 cloud albedo feedback scheme </li>
 <li>Meehl (1997) for details on the spin-up and systematic errors
 </li>
 <li>Washington and Meehl (1996) for basic description of a 1%
 per year CO2 increase experiment and features of the high latitude
 response in the northern Hemisphere </li>
 <li>Meehl and Washington (1996) for description of the ``El Nino-like&quot;
 pattern in the 1% CO2 increase sensitivity experiment</li>
 <li>Meehl et al. (1996) for results from a set of sensitivity
 experiments including the 1% per year CO2 increase experiment
 compared to experiments that include direct and indirect effects
 of sulphate aerosols.</li>
 </ul>

 Two climate change experiments were performed, both starting in
 the year 1900. The first uses greenhouse gas radiative forcing
 (represented by equivalent CO2) observed during the 20th century,
 and extends greenhouse gas forcing to the year 2035 by increasing
 CO2 1% per year compound after 1990 (CO2-only experiment). The
 second includes the same greenhouse gas (equivalent CO2) forcing
 as the first, but adds the effects of time-varying geographic
 distributions of monthly sulphate aerosol radiative forcing (CO2+sulphates
 experiment). These are compared to a 135-year control experiment
 with no change in external forcing. Climate system responses in
 the CO2-only and CO2+sulphates experiments are marked not only
 by greater warming at high latitudes in the winter hemisphere,
 but also by a global &quot;El Nino-like&quot; pattern in surface
 temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure. This is characterized
 by relatively greater increase of SST in the central and eastern
 equatorial Pacific compared to the west, a shift of precipitation
 maxima from the western Pacific to the central Pacific, mostly
 decreases of Asian-Australian monsoon strength, lower pressure
 over the eastern tropical Pacific, deeper midlatitude troughs
 in the north and south Pacific, and higher pressure over Australasia.
 An EOF analysis of surface temperature indicates that the &quot;El
 Nino-like&quot; pattern in the model characterizes not only CO2-only
 and CO2+sulphates climate system response to time-varying external
 forcing, but also internally-generated climate variability at
 the El Nino and decadal (9-20 year) timescales. These results
 indicate that the &quot;El Nino-like&quot; pattern is a ubiquitous
 response in the climate system that occurs at different timescales
 due to different forcings. The coupled model climate change experiments
 show that time-evolving external forcing can introduce this same
 low frequency response pattern into the coupled climate system.</p>
