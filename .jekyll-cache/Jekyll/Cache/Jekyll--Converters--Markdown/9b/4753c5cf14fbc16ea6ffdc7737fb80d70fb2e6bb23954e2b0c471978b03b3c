<p><b>Background Information</b></p>

<p>The model used here is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that
 consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM,
 a thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model (Abe-Ouchi
 <i>et al</i>., 1996). The spatial resolution is <a href="ccsr_grid.html">T21 spectral truncation (roughly 5.6&ordm;
 latitude/longitude)</a> and 20 vertical levels for the atmospheric
 part, and roughly 2.8&ordm; horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels
 for the oceanic part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat
 and water exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled
 climate.</p>

<p>The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the
 k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM) (Nakajima
 and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with absorption, emission
 and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol particles in a consistent
 manner. In the calculation of sulphate aerosol optical properties,
 the volumetric mode radius of the sulphate particle in dry environment
 is assumed to be 0.2 micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate
 is considered by an empirical fit of d'Almeida <i>et al</i>. (1991).
 The vertical distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to
 be constant in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations
 of greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2.</p>

<p>Three integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090).
 In the control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration
 of greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent
 and the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment
 GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually increased,
 while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiments GS,
 the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well as that in greenhouse
 gases is given and the aerosol scattering (the direct effect of
 aerosol) is explicitly represented in the way described above.
 The indirect effect of aerosol is not included in any experiment.</p>

<p>The scenario of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases
 and sulphate aerosols is given in accordance with Mitchell and
 Johns (1997). The increase in greenhouse gases is based on the
 historical record from 1890 to 1990 and is increased by 1% / yr
 (compound) after 1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions
 of sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by
 a sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic
 patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission rates,
 the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the 2050 pattern
 is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is interpolated
 from the two basic ones for intermediate years to give the time
 series of the distribution. The sulphur emission rate in the future
 is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The sulphate concentration
 is offset in our run so that it starts from zero at 1890. The
 seasonal variation of sulphate concentration is ignored.</p>

<p>Discussion on the results of the experiments will be found
 in Emori <i>et al</i>. (1999). Climate sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES
 model derived by equilibrium runs is estimated to be 3.5 degrees
 Celsius.</p>
