<a name="baseline"></a>
<h3>Baseline/Reference</h3><p>The baseline (or reference) is the state against which change is measured. A baseline period  is the period relative to which anomalies are computed. The baseline concentration ofa trace gas is that measured at a location not influenced by local <a href="glossary_a.html#anthropogenic">anthropogenic</a> emissions. <b>WGI</b></p> 
<p>In the context of transformation pathways, the term 'baseline scenarios' refers to <a href="glossary_s.html#scenario">scenarios</a> that are based on the assumption that no <a href="glossary_lm.html#mitigation">mitigation</a> policies or <a href="glossary_lm.html#measures">measures</a> will be implemented beyond those that are already in force and/or are legislated or planned to be adopted. Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions of the future, but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve to highlight the level of emissions that would occur without further <a href="glossary_pq.html#policies">policy</a> effort. Typically, baseline scenarios are then compared to mitigation scenarios that are constructed to meet different goals for <a href="glossary_fg.html#greenhouseGas">greenhouse gas (GHG)</a> emissions, atmosphereic concentrations, or temperature change. The term 'baseline scenario' is used interchangeably with 'reference scenario' and 'no policy scenario'. In much of the literature the term is also synonymous with the term 'business-as-usual (BAU) scenario', although the term 'BAU' has fallen out of favour because the idea of business-as-usual in century-long socioeconomic projections is hard to fathom. <b>WGIII</b></p>
<p>See also <a href="glossary_c.html#climateScenario">Climate scenario</a>, <a href="glossary_e.html#emissionScenario">Emission scenario</a>, <a href="glossary_r.html#rcp">Representative concentration pathways (RCPs)</a>, <a href="glossary_s.html#socioEconomicScenario">Socio-economic scenarios</a>, and <a href="glossary_s.html#sresScenarios">SRES scenarios</a>.</p>
<a name="biosphere"></a>
<h3>Biosphere (Terrestrial and Marine)</h3><p>The part of the Earth system comprising all ecosystems and living organisms, in the atmosphere, on land (terrestrial biosphere) or in the oceans (marine biosphere), including derived dead organic matter, such as litter, soil organic matter and oceanic detritus. <b>WGIII</b></p>
<a name="bc"></a>
<h3>Black Carbon (BC)</h3><p>Operationally defined <a href="glossary_a.html#aerosols">aerosol</a> species based on measurement of light absorption and chemical reactivity and/or thermal stability. It is sometimes referred to as soot. BC is mostly formed by the incomplete combustion of <a href="glossary_fg.html#fossilFuels">fossil fuels</a>, biofuels, and biomass but it also occurs naturally. It stays in the <a href="glossary_a.html#atmosphere">atmosphere</a> only for days or weeks. It is the most strongly light-absorbing component of <a href="glossary_pq.html#particulateMatter">particulate matter (PM)</a> and has a warming effect by absorbing heat into the atmosphere and reducing the <a href="glossary_a.html#albedo">albedo</a> when deposited on ice or snow. <b>WGIII</b></p>
