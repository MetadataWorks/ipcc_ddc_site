 <p> GCM outputs are not generally of a sufficient resolution or reliability to be applied directly
 to represent the present-day climate. Instead, it is usual for baseline observational data to be
 used, which are commonly in the form of time series of daily or monthly data for several variables
 over a period such as 1961-1990.</p>
 
 <p> A scenario of future climate is obtained by adjusting the baseline observations by the difference
 (or ratio) between period-averaged results for the GCM experiment (usually 10 or 30 year periods
 are used) and the corresponding averages for the GCM control simulation. In recent transient
 experiments, the simulated baseline period (e.g. 1961-1990) is used in place of the control-run results.
 Differences are usually applied for temperature changes (e.g. 2040-2069 minus 1961-1990) while ratios
 are commonly used for precipitation change (e.g. 2040-2069 divided by 1961-1990), though differences
 may be preferred in some cases. When this procedure is completed across some or all of the model
 grid boxes, a pattern of differences or ratios known as a "change field" is produced. Change fields of
 30-year averages for eight variables have been computed from the monthly outputs of all experiments
 held in the Data Distribution Centre. In this case, changes for all variables are expressed as
 differences relative to the present, where the present refers to model simulated 1961-1990 climate.</p>
