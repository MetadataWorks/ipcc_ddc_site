          <li>The ANNs models can be trained to find the best mathematical relationship between the atmospheric circulation and local climate, without predefined restrictions. Thus the method is able to capture some of the non-linear relationships between local climate and the large-scale circulation (Sahai et al., 2000; Knutti et al., 2003). Through this analysis of downscaling and RNA, we can verify more through detailed technique, possible climate changes on the South America mainly in relation to the precipitation. </li>

          <li>No [3 occurrences]</li>
          <li>Yes, thhy did.</li>
          <li>Yes, but handling the data is not so smooth as other reanalysis data may be of my ignorance.we would like to get temperature data monthy in one .nc or .grdlike NCEP and ECMWF files</li>
          <li>Unfortanely, not all the models had the geopotential height variable avaliable.</li>
          <li>not all the data available to download, so some data don't meet the requirement</li>
          <li>some resources meet my requirements.the resources i wanted are more small areas and accurate. </li>
          <li>Somewhat, but they need to be downscaled or input onto regional models</li>
          <li>Not completely, I am using another database now, because an expert told me that database was more relevant for my research. The great thing about your database though, is that you have sunlight data</li>
          <li>mainly, yes</li>
          <li>Yes, GREAT DATA! I wish I also had access to Regional Simulation results, like that of PRECIS for Indian subcontinent.</li>
          <li>Mostly. However, the data resolution was not always sufficient for my studies.</li>
          <li>yes, of course!!</li>
          <li>I can say yes in general, but the scale for studies of impacts is large.</li>
          <li>Yes, within the limits of what is available (of course we would like higher spatial and temporal resolution model output!)</li>
          <li>75% of the times. </li>
          <li>used WCRP CMIP3 data archive instead</li>
          <li>Yes - our key need were the daily data from the models</li>
          <li>Almost </li>
          <li>Party. Some of them needs to be submitted to file convertion.</li>
          <li>In part. We are still seeking additional data on impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability.</li>
          <li>partly - I couldn't find monthly rainfall data prepared in ascii so that I had to analyse image pattern data, which has become too high efford</li>
          <li>yes,to some extent</li>
          <li>yes, especially details fro AR4 were usefull</li>
          <li>ok</li>
          <li>was hard to extract data from the grid. maybe a more flexible way to access specific data would be nice</li>
          <li>yes, but need to add daily and hourly data</li>
          <li>Partly</li>
          <li>Generally yes, but not always. Because I wanted data in grib format sometimes, but DDC just provided netCDF format.</li>
          <li>Yes. I would like to see more data about my region of interest (Red Sea and Gulf of Aden) like monthly observations of climate data, it is very diffecult to get the data here.</li>
          <li>Some datasets that we considered of special interest are listed but not available for download</li>
          <li>NO.  I need data at two differennt altitudes.  I was able to obtain data only for one altitute.</li>
          <li>yes</li>
          <li>Yes to major extent, but resolution needs to be improved for assessing regional climate picture.</li>
          <li>Yes they did.</li>
          <li>Mostly.</li>
          <li>Not much</li>
          <li>mainly, yes</li>
          <li>Yes our DMH is still doing to get the access</li>
          <li>I use a PC  -- beyond ncdump and the equivalent grib tools I have not been able to make tools for accessing nc and grib files work.</li>
          <li>To add software with data to access specific zone will be great help to reduce computation load. </li>
          <li>Yes,but not enough</li>
          <li>Yes, completely.</li>
          <li>The resources fit my requirements perfectly. I could not have completed my research without them.</li>
          <li>Almost all</li>
          <li>not completely</li>
          <li>no, it is very difficult to download the dataset,the download speed is very slow and always stop before download the full dataset.</li>
          <li>I need 6-hourly 3-D data, only one matches my requirement</li>
          <li>Usually but not always. I have recommendations to make about handling the Assessment Report findings.</li>
          <li>Yes. But monthly means sometimes do not meet our requirements. It would be good to have daily data besides monthly means.</li>
          <li>GIS data needs better projections</li>
          <li>The data format is difficult to work with.</li>
          <li>Yes. The IPCC DDC resources were very usefull.</li>
          <li>I think so.</li>
          <li>Yes,although I would use the model climate projections more if they were a bit more user-friendly</li>
          <li>not anougth</li>
          <li>I have trouble getting projections at a sufficiently fine spatial scale</li>
          <li>to some extent, yes</li>
          <li>yes, but if a GIS format could be availed it can be more useful</li>
          <li>In my opinion, construction of climate scenarios from the available raw GCM data is still difficult for someone new to the field. As much as I understand this is a specialised field, the usability of the GCM results should be be irrespective of the user's background. I would appreciate a more clear (preferably stepwise) instruction on how to construct scenarios from the posted raw data for use in research. </li>
          <li>yes, absolutely</li>
          <li>Sure</li>

          <li>1. Regional Simulation results, e.g. from PRECIS, will help a lot to understand the variabilities at a finer spatial scale. 2. I find myself comfortable with the data from WDCC (CERA-www.dkrz.de), because it provides data in ascii format. The only problem is that the data is downloaded in 6 columns, and when the longitude range is longer, one has to re-configure the data columns from the original 6-col set to transfer the data in compatible format in GIS. GRIB and NC formats difficult to open in available GIS software, and need special software and their manipulations that are currently beyond my capacity. Wish, the data centres provided a simple software where one can import and open the data with a single click in WINDOWS (without the need for compilation of routins, etc.). NC data is very compact, but data centres do not provide any user-friendly software. 3. The best format that I get today is from NASA-Giovanni, which provides both the image map and the data download facility (in ASCII; XYZ; Lat., Long, value; NC; others)for any geographical area one wishes. 4. Since 8 years of the present century have passed, some results on simulation results vis-a-vis the observations can be posted for those years (monthly; daily).  </li>

          <li>The DDC is an essential resource!</li>
          <li>What I might suggest to improve DDC, is to provide adequate softwares on transforming data to what is usually used in statistical and mathematical softwares. </li>
          <li>I CONSIDER THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY IPCC THE BEST SO FAR FOR THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES. ONE HAS NEVER SEEN SUCH OPENNESS OF APPROACH, NOR SUCH ZEAL TO HELP! IT IS FOR US TO UTILIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES, UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE PROPERLY THE SCIENCE AS WELL AS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS TO INCREASE THE AWARENESS OF THE IMPENDING CHANGES.</li>
          <li>Many thanks for your work!</li>
          <li>I am very pleased that I can these data to enhance my knowledge.</li>
          <li>the IPCC data are so useful to support my research</li>
          <li>Thanks a lot for your help whenever I requested it!</li>
          <li>It could be great to save more 3-D data or give the link where the 3-D data can be downloaded.</li>
          <li>Thank to IPCC for providing all the supporting materials and data free of charge and easilly for download  for every researcher.</li>
          <li>Data format could also be GIS suitable eg. ArcGIS ASCII GRID or ERDAS IMAGINE (*.img)</li>
          <li>Nothing</li>
          <li>I am chainging my focus from scenarios and mitigation tools to impacts.  The learning process has been longer and harder than i anticipated.</li>
          <li>No comments</li>
          <li>It's a great job!</li>
          <li>No comments</li>
          <li>I work with EXCEL, and it was nice to have a data format that was able to use there.</li>
          <li>The data are in a format that is difficult for occasional users to access.</li>
          <li>I do not think that the IPCC DDC pages are very easy to use. When you click on a link on the left (e.g. Climate models | Summary data | AR4 (2007) etc...) you get to a page called Model output described in the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (SRES scenarios), multi-year means so you never know if you are on the right page. Many links take you away from the IPCC pages to somewhere completely different. This is really against all rules for website design and is so non-standard its hard to see where you are. A proper structure would start with a full concise explanation, then go down through each level, making it easy to find and easy to understand.</li>
          <li>IPCC DDC good data source for first approximations of climate change. Thank you!</li>
          <li>If there are other languages such as Chinese in the DDC, it would be more useful and convenient for researchers in non-English speaking countries.  </li>
          <li>Re question 12 - it is a balance ... and asking for a choice of 1 is misleading. I need the right data, but it has to be in the right data format too !</li>
          <li>Keep the data coming! If possible, in finer resolution.</li>
          <li>We look to worke togather in ouer region to improve the climate model and enabling activites in arab region and Med.</li>
          <li>It is better if the IPCC DDC can afford the Chinese guidance material.  Thanks.</li>
          <li>Your service is powerful and quite complete, but I miss sufficient preparation of provided data in a way that makes it easier for analytical purpose. It is good for demonstation of results and conclusions already done by IPCC. The forecast area shows certain models with different scenarios. I miss a short introduction to the certain models about their intentions and theoretical background. In addition these data are provided in SI units that are not common in engineering science. To find technical solutions in certain areas focuses on targets, where analysing data is often a work has to be done it atmost efficient ways - anyways, to ensure realistic and appropriate technical solutions e.g. in the field of water or energy supply, not only the availlability of data is important. Due to time pressure one has to chose data prepared in the best usable preparation - this is not necessarily connected to approprite data quality. The errors, which are imported by inappropriate data quality will multiply just by reason of required efficiency in engineering work. My suggestion is to thik also about practical application, not only research.  Thanks, Joachim Hellmold</li>
          <li>data may be provided in MS Access or Excel format</li>
          <li>I hope the download speed can become more quickly. for example,if I download a dataset that is 16MB and I have to spend 5 hours if I am very luck</li>
          <li>The DDC website is sometimes a bit difficult to navigate. Users need to have a clear idea of what data they want. This is fine for the expert community. However, if a larger audience is to be addressed some alternative forms of data presentation might be advisable.</li>
          <li>Thank you very much for the staff's tremendous effort. Please continue and maintain this service for long time.</li>
          <li>Keep up the god work!</li>
