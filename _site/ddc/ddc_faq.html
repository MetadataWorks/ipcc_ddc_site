<p style="font-size:+1;font-style:Geneva"><a name="anchor1031507"></a><b>GCMs</b></p>

<p style="font-size:-1;font-style:Geneva"><b>Q. Which GCM output should I use?</b></p>

<p><b>A. </b>Many climate change experiments have been performed with GCMs.
 Four criteria for selection of which GCM(s)' output to use for an impact study have been suggested:
 vintage, resolution, validity and representativeness of results.</p>

<p><i>Vintage.</i> In general, recent model simulations are likely
 (though by no means certain) to be more reliable than those of
 an earlier vintage. They are based on recent knowledge, incorporate
 more processes and feedbacks and are usually of a higher spatial
 resolution than earlier models.</p>

<p><i>Resolution</i>. As climate models have evolved and computing
 power has increased, there has been a tendency towards increased
 resolution. Some of the early GCMs operated on a horizontal resolution
 of some 1000 km with between 2 and 10 levels in the vertical.
 More recent models are run at nearer 250 km spatial resolution
 with perhaps 20 vertical levels. However, although higher resolution
 models contain more spatial detail this does not necessarily guarantee
 a superior model performance.</p>

<p><i>Validity</i>. A more persuasive criterion for model selection
 is to adopt the GCMs that simulate the present-day climate most
 faithfully, on the premise that these GCMs would also yield the
 most reliable representation of future climate. The approach involves
 comparing GCM simulations that represent present-day conditions
 with the observed climate. The modelled and observed data are
 projected to the same grid, and statistical methods employed to
 compare, for example, mean values, variability and climatic patterns.
 Some model-observed comparisons are possible using the <a href="https://apps.ipcc-data.org/maps/" target="_top">Data Visualisation Pages</a> of the DDC.</p>

<p><i>Representativeness</i>. If results from more than one GCM
 are to be applied in an impact assessment (and given the known
 uncertainties of GCMs, this is strongly recommended), another
 criterion for selection is to examine the representativeness of
 the results. Where several GCMs are to be selected, it might be
 prudent to choose models that show a range of changes in a key
 variable in the study region (for example, models showing little
 change in precipitation, models showing an increase and models
 showing a decrease). The selections may not necessarily be the
 best validated models (see above), although some combination of
 models satisfying both criteria couldbe agreed upon.</p>

<p style="font-size:-1;font-style:Geneva"><b>Q. How do I get climate change projections for a particular location?

<p><b><font SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Q. What CO2 concentration
 accompanies what GCM scenario?</font></b></p>

<p>The greenhouse gas forcing scenarios used by all of the GCM
 experiments reported on the DDC are expressed in terms of <i>equivalent</i>
 CO2 concentrations. Most of these experiments use a forcing scenario
 of 1% per annum increase in equivalent greenhouse gas concentrations
 (HadCM2 also uses a ~0.5% per annum forced scenario). None of
 the model experiments therefore explicitly calculate, or assume,
 an actual CO2 (as opposed to an <i>equivalent</i> CO2) concentration
 curve, yet for many impacts studies it is the <i>actual</i> CO2
 concentration that is needed. Of the IPCC IS92 emissions scenarios,
 the 1% per annum increase in CO2 equivalent concentration is best
 approximated by the IS92a emissions scenario (according to IPCC
 1996 calculations). We can therefore use the mix of greenhouse
 gases reported in the IS92a scenario to estimate the CO2 concentration
 path associated with the 1% per annum forcing used by the GCMs
 (we use the IS92d emissions scenario to estimate the CO2 concentrations
 for the ~0.5% per annum forced experiments). We have done this
 using the same set of emissions-concentrations-forcing relationships
 used in IPCC 1996. The CO2 concentrations for the 2020s, 2050s
 and 2080s listed in the Tables on the <a href="/sim/gcm_monthly/" target="frame256263">GCM Experiments Pages</a> have been estimated
 in this way.</p>
<p>–&gt;</p>

<p style="font-size:-1;font-style:Geneva"><b>Q. Why are changes in Tmean
 not always the average of changes in Tmin and Tmax?</b></p>

<p><b>A.</b> Whether or not the change in mean monthly mean temperature
 is the average of the changes in mean monthly Tmin and Tmax depends
 on how the particular GCM calculates its daily Tmean, Tmin and
 Tmax. In HadCM2, for example, the daily Tmean is the average temperature
 over 24 hours (the average of 48 half hourly calculations), whereas
 daily Tmin is the lowest temperature reached in a day and Tmax
 is the highest temperature reached in a day. Clearly, in this
 case unless there is a perfect sine curve in the diurnal temperature
 cycle then daily Tmean need not be the average of daily Tmin and
 daily Tmax. Since the monthly and 30-year mean monthly values
 are derived from the daily temperatures, this explains why changes
 in Tmean may not equal the average of changes in Tmin and Tmax.
 How close Tmean changes are to the average of Tmin and Tmax changes
 depends on how the model calculates these daily quantities and
 on the shape of the diurnal cycle.</p>

<p>Changes in 30-year mean diurnal temperature range (&#42;DTR) for
 the DDC results are calculated as the difference between the changes
 in the 30-year mean monthly Tmax and Tmin changes.</p>

<p><!-- <p>At present however, it is possible to obtain the total <A
 HREF="../examine/hadcm2/HadCM2_changes.html" TARGET="_self">global-mean
 sea-level rise for HadCM2</A>. This is because an off-line ice-melt
 model has been used in conjunction with HadCM2 climate output
 to generate the ice-melt contribution and this, when combined
 with HadCM2's thermal expansion, yields a consistent estimate
 of total sea-level rise.</p> --></p>

<p style="font-size:-1;font-style:Geneva"><b>Q. What is the climate sensitivity
 of a GCM?</b></p>

<p>The term &quot;climate sensitivity&quot; refers to the steady-state
 increase in the global annual mean surface air temperature associated
 with a given global-mean radiative forcing. It is common practise
 to use CO2 doubling as a benchmark for comparing GCM climate sensitivities.
 Thus in practise the climate sensitivity may be defined as the
 change in global-mean temperature that would ultimately be reached
 following a doubling of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere
 (e.g. from 275 ppmv to 550 ppmv). The Intergovernmental Panel
 on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report reported the likely range
 for this quantity to be between 2&ordm; and 4.5&ordm;C, with
 a 'best' estimate of 3&ordm;C.</p>

<p>Each GCM possesses a different climate sensitivity, depending
 on the representation of various feedback processes in the model,
 including water vapour. It is generally assumed that the climate
 sensitivity of a model is approximately constant over the range
 of forcings expected for the next century. The climate sensitivity
 of a model is also largely independent (&plusmn;10%) of the specific
 combination of different forcing factors (solar, aerosols, CO2,
 CH4, etc.) that produce a given global-mean forcing.</p>

<p style="font-size:-1;font-style:Geneva"><b>Q. How should I define a GCM
 change field?</b></p>

<p>It is usual practise in climate scenario construction to use
 the <i>change</i> in climate from present to future conditions
 simulated by a climate model, rather than use directly the actual
 future climate from the model. This is mainly because the climatology
 of a GCM may sometimes, and for some regions, be rather different
 from that observed.</p>

<p>The change fields from a GCM experiment can be defined in a
 number of ways. The approach we have followed on this web site
 and for the DDC models is to adopt the 30-year simulation period
 1961-90 in the models as the reference period and then calculate
 change fields for future 30-year periods, namely the 2020s (2010-2039),
 the 2050s (2040-2069) and the 2080s (2070-2099).
 <!-- The data files
 available from the <A HREF="../datadownload/download_index.html"
 TARGET="_top">Green Site Data Download Pages </A>contain these
 calculated 30-year mean GCM change fields. -->
 </p>

<p>It is also possible to calculate change fields using the unforced
 (control) simulations of the respective GCM.
 <!-- (these are available
 from the <A HREF="../../dkrz/dkrz_index.html" TARGET="_top">Yellow
 Pages</A>).-->
 In this case one should be careful when applying the
 change fields since they define the magnitude of climate change
 since pre-industrial times (e.g. ~ 1800) rather than from the
 1961-90 period.</p>

<p><a href="#anchor559935" target="frame256263">Back to Top</a></p>

<p style="font-size:-1;font-style:Geneva"><b>Q. What are GCM ensembles?</b></p>

<p><b>A. </b>GCM predictions of climate change may depend upon
 the choice of point on the control run at which increasing greenhouse
 gas concentrations are introduced. For this reason, some modelling
 centres have performed &quot;ensemble&quot; simulations with their
 climate model. In such cases, a number of identical model experiments
 are performed with the same historical changes and future changes
 in greenhouse gases, but these changes are initiated from different
 points on the control run. The underlying climate change predicted
 by each of these model experiments is very similar, showing that
 the initial condition is not important to the long-term change.
 However, there are significant year-to-year and decade-to-decade
 differences in the resulting climate. These differences are due
 to natural climate variability and are particularly large at regional
 scales and for some variables such as precipitation. For this
 reason, results from the different members of an ensemble may
 be averaged together to provide a more robust estimate of the
 climate change.</p>

<p>Of the models posted on the DDC web site, HadCM2 and CGCM1
 have been used in this way and results from individual ensemble
 members, as well as the ensemble-mean, may be downloaded.</p>

<p style="font-size:-1;font-style:Geneva"><a name="anchor1175477"></a><b>Q.
 How do I add the GCM fields to my baseline data?</b></p>

<p>GCM change fields generally exist on coarser space scales than
 the observational climate data being used in a project. For example,
 the observational dataset available from the DDC Pages exists
 at 0.5&ordm; latitude/longitude resolution whereas the GCM data
 exist at scales large than 2.5&ordm; latitude/longitude. There
 are a number of ways GCM changes and observed data may be combined:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The same GCM change value may be added to each observational
 data point or grid cell that exists within the respective GCM
 gridbox.</li>
 <li>GCM change values may be interpolated to the appropriate
 observed resolution using a variety of simple spatial interpolation
 methods (e.g. linear interpolation or gaussian space-filtering).</li>
 <li>GCM change values may be 'downscaled' to the appropriate
 observed resolution using a variety of dynamical or empirical
 techniques (see <a href="#anchor1173464" target="frame256263">Question
 below)</a>.</li>
 </ul>

<p>Whatever method is used, be careful to combine variables that
 are describing the same meteorological variable, e.g. cloud cover
 with cloud cover, vapour pressure with vapour pressure, etc. The
 variables deposited with the DDC by modelling centres are not
 always directly compatible with the observed variables most commonly
 used in impacts studies.</p>

<p style="font-size:-1;font-style:Geneva"><a name="anchor1173464"></a><b>Q.
 How can I downscale the GCM data to smaller scales?</b></p>

<p>One of the simplest ways of adding spatial detail to GCM-based
 climate change scenarios is to interpolate GCM-scale changes to
 a finer resolution and then combine these interpolated changes
 with observed climate information at the fine resolution (<a href="#anchor1175477">see Question above</a>). This may be achieved
 using high resolution observed mean monthly climatologies or can
 be done simply by perturbing an observed monthly or daily time
 series for a site or catchment by the GCM changes interpolated
 to the site in question. This approach is sometimes termed 'unintelligent'
 downscaling because no new meteorological insight is added in
 the interpolation process that goes beyond the GCM-based changes;
 the basic spatial patterns of present climate are assumed to remain
 largely unchanged in the future. This very simple approach to
 downscaling is easy to apply and allows impact assessment models
 to use climate scenarios at a resolution that would otherwise
 be difficult or costly to obtain.</p>

<p>Another downscaling option is to use a higher resolution limited-area
 model (often called a Regional Climate Model - RCM) to generate
 climate change scenarios at the required resolution. Such regional
 climate models typically cover an area the size of Europe, have
 a spatial resolution of about 30-50 km and are driven by boundary
 conditions taken from the GCM for one particular period in the
 present and one in the future. This approach has been adopted
 by a number of modelling centres around the world. The DDC does
 not currently contain any results from RCM experiments and not
 many impact studies have yet used results from RCM experiments.</p>

<p>Because unintelligent downscaling assumes that climate change
 will be uniform over GCM grid-scales and because RCMs are slow
 and expensive to run, another set of approaches to the downscaling
 problem has been developed for scenario applications. These approaches
 may conveniently be grouped together as statistical downscaling
 methods. There are at least three broad clusters of methods within
 this general category - regression methods, circulation typing
 schemes, and stochastic weather generators. Developing a statistical
 downscaling model is usually quite time-intensive and will <i>always</i>
 require very extensive observational data - daily/hourly weather
 data, for the surface and maybe for the upper air, and usually
 for several/many sites or gridboxes covering the region of interest.
 It need not necessarily be a cheaper or easier option than running
 an RCM. It should also be noted that most downscaling methods
 and models are developed with a specific application in mind -
 whether agriculture, forestry, water, etc. - and quite often for
 a specific geographic region. Not all downscaling methods can
 easily be transported from one region to another. In each case,
 just as with a regional climate model, the derived regional scenarios
 depend on the validity of the GCM output.</p>

<p style="font-size:-1;font-style:Geneva"><b><font SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Q. How do I introduce changes
 in interannual or interdaily variability into my scenario?</font></b></p>

<p>The 30-year mean monthly GCM change fields <!-- available from the
 DDC Green <A HREF="../datadownload/download_index.html" TARGET="_top">Data
 Download Pages</A> --> do not contain any information about changes
 in interannual or interdaily variability. Sometimes this information
 may be very important to include in an impact study. Changes in
 interannual variability can be calculated using the monthly time
 series GCM data. <!--available from the <A HREF="../../dkrz/dkrz_index.html"
 TARGET="_top">DDC Yellow Pages</A>.--> In this case, it is suggested
 to calculate the ratio of the standard deviation in the future
 time-slice compared to the 1961-90 time-slice and then impose
 this ratio on the observed time series climate data (note: if
 you do not have observed interannual variability data available
 for your study, then you cannot incorporate interannual variability
 changes). This ratio will either inflate or deflate the observed
 interannual variations.</p>

<p>To introduce GCM changes in interdaily climate variability,
 it is necessary to access daily GCM data. The DDC does not hold
 daily model data and users are directed to the individual modelling
 centres to gain access.<br />
 </p>

<p style="font-size:-1;font-style:Geneva"><b><font SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Q. What are weather generators?</font></b></p>

<p>Weather generators can be used to construct site-specific or
 small-scale climate change scenarios, although they rely on a
 slightly different approach from other statistical downscaling
 methods. A weather generator is calibrated on an observed daily
 weather series over some appropriate period, usually for a site,
 but possibly for a catchment or a small gridbox. The generator
 is then capable of generating, stochastically, an infinite series
 of daily weather for the respective spatial domain. This generated
 time series will possess - in theory - the correct (i.e., the
 observed) lower and higher order climate statistics for that domain.</p>

<p>The parameters of the weather generator can then be perturbed
 using output from a GCM, allowing the generator to yield synthetic
 daily weather for the climate change scenario. To derive the appropriate
 WG parameter perturbation from the coarse-scale GCM, other downscaling
 methods need to be employed. One of the weaknesses of weather
 generators is that because they are stochastically based, they
 do not always capture the low frequency variations (e.g. multi-year
 or multi-decadal variations) in climate that may be quite important
 for certain impacts applications. The following reference compares
 the performance of two widely used weather generators: Semenov,M.A.,
 Brooks,R.J., Barrow,E.M. and Richardson,C.W. <b>(1998)</b> Comparison

<p style="font-size:-1;font-style:Geneva"><b><font SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Q. Should I take 1961-90 or
 1990 as my baseline?</font></b></p>

<p><b>A. </b>IPCC have usually taken the year '1990' as the baseline
 year for the presentation of emissions scenarios and for calculations
 of future climate and sea-level change. '1990' has also been adopted
 by the UN FCCC in their definition of emissions reductions targets.
 Choosing a single year as a baseline is appropriate for some applications,
 but not for others.</p>

<p>With regard to climate, for example, a single year is not appropriate
 to use as the baseline. Climate variability means that a single
 year may be unusually warm or cold or dry or wet and does not
 therefore make a useful reference point for measuring climate
 change. More common in climatological applications is the use
 of the average climate over a 30-year period to define the reference
 or baseline climate. A 30-year climatic average smoothes out many
 of the year-to-year variations in climate, while the individual
 30 years of such a period captures much of the interannual and
 short time-scale variability of climate that may be relevant for
 an impact application. It is also desirable to use such a multi-year
 period rather than a single year to define climate change fields
 extracted from GCM simulations.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we suggest the period 1961-90 generally
 be used as the baseline period. This period has generally good
 observed data availability (e.g. the <a href="/observ/clim/cru_climatologies.html" target="frame256263">observed climatology described by the DDC</a>),
 it represents the recent climate to which many present-day human
 or natural systems are likely to be reasonably well adapted, and
 the period ends in 1990, the year adopted by many IPCC and UN
 FCCC applications.</p>

<h5><font FACE="Geneva">Q. What non-climatic scenario should I use?</font></h5>

<p>The non-climatic forcing scenarios used in experiments available through the
 DDC do not originate directly from any coherent future view of the world. They
 are an arbitrary imposition of a 1% per annum growth in future greenhouse gas
 concentrations. In fact, the closest of the SRES emissions to a 1% per annum
 growth is SRES A2, and the closest of the IS92 emissions scenarios is the IS92a
 scenario (IPCC 1996 calculated the equivalent per annum growth rate in
 concentrations for IS92a to be about 0.85% per annum). It is therefore not
 unreasonable to use the SRES A2 or IS92a assumptions about population, GDP and
 energy technology to create the background world in which the projected climate
 changes might occur.</p>

<p><b>A. </b>The <a href="https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.html" target="frame256263">Kyoto Protocol</a> agreed at the Third Conference of the
 Parties to the <a href="https://unfccc.int/" target="frame256263">UN Framework
 Convention on Climate Change</a> in December 1997, sets a target for developed
 countries to reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases by about 5% by the period
 2008-2012 with respect to 1990 levels. Should this Protocol be ratified and
 adhered to, there are modest implications for future climate change and sea
 level.</p>

<p>Neither the IS92 nor the Preliminary SRES emissions scenarios available from
 the DDC, nor any of the forcing scenarios used by GCM experiments, include the
 effect of the Kyoto Protocol on future emissions or radiative forcing. Climate
 change scenarios obtained from the DDC should be regarded therefore as
 'non-interventionist' scenarios. A separate scenario exercise would need to be
 undertaken to consider the effects of the Kyoto Protocol, although it has been
 shown that the effect of the Kyoto Protocol on future climate change is likely
 to be modest.</p>
