<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:11.0pt'>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
Data Distribution Centre (DDC) provides access to data sets, climate and other
scenarios, and other materials (e.g., technical guidelines on use of
scenarios). The DDC operates under the oversight of the Task Group on Data and
Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Assessment (TGICA), which was
established by the IPCC to facilitate wide availability of climate
change-related data and scenarios to enable research and sharing of information
across the three IPCC working groups.</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>The activities
     and membership of the TGICA are defined by its mandate, as approved by the
     IPCC. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>The TGICA is
     responsible for the DDC, providing leadership and oversight for its
     operations. It makes decisions about the materials (observational data,
     model data)  to be included in the DDC. As specified in the TGICA’s
     mandate, information provided through the DDC includes IPCC “approved,”
     “adopted,” “accepted,” and “supporting” material. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>The TGICA makes
     decisions by consensus. All members of the Task Group participate in
     decision-making. Decisions regarding model data and scenarios are made in
     consultation with participating modeling centers. Decisions regarding
     operations of the DDC are made with the full participation of the DDC
     managers and reflect the expertise, responsibilities, and operating
     procedures of the institutions that comprise the DDC.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>The DDC supports
     </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>research on climate
     impacts, adaptation, and mitigation, promotes communication and exchange
     of information across the IPCC Working Groups, and facilitates studies
     that use consistent scenarios and baseline data for integration into IPCC
     assessments. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>In its
     operations, the DDC will seek to build capacity for climate-related
     research in developing and transition-economy regions and countries.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>The DDC will
     support users of the data and information it disseminates. TGICA’s
     membership is designed to include representatives of different research
     communities who use climate-related data and scenarios. These members are
     responsible for representing user needs and perspectives. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>The data and
     information on the DDC are available free of charge to all users. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>The operations
     of the DDC are primarily funded through voluntary “in-kind” contributions
     from governments that support the participating data centers that comprise
     the DDC. The TGICA seeks to maintain regular communication with
     representatives of supporting governments and the home institutions of the
     data centers. </span></li>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>The DDC is a
     shared operation of the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) in the
     United Kingdom; the World Data Center Climate at the Max-Planck-Institute
     for Meteorology (WDCC / MPI-M) in Hamburg, Germany; and the Socioeconomic
     Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) operated by the Center for
     International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) at Columbia
     University, New York, USA. Each of these institutions has voluntarily
     taken on responsibility for managing access to a subset of the data and
     information provided by the DDC. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>The DDC Managers
     make decisions by consensus. Lead responsibility for the DDC currently
     rests with the British Atmospheric Data Centrer, which coordinates the
     overall management of the DDC. Any one of the DDC Managers may bring
     matters to the attention of the TGICA.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>The DDC Managers
     are accountable for the successful operation of the DDC. They are charged
     with developing and maintaining the DDC in keeping with international
     standards and “best practices” for user access and support, appropriate
     cataloging, documentation, quality control, archiving, and preservation of
     DDC holdings. The DDC Managers are empowered to undertake the following
     actions:</span></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>Design and
      modify the DDC site in keeping with the overall direction provided by the
      TGICA to ensure that the DDC evolves and keeps up with changes in
      technology and standards. The objective is to make sure that the
      information on the DDC is easily accessible and usable.</span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>Carry out
      performance monitoring and reporting including use and quality
      statistics.</span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>Solicit user
      feedback and reactions to the site and report these regularly to the
      TGICA.</span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>Develop
      proposals for improving the content, data delivery, and user support of
      the DDC for review and approval by the TGICA. Proposals for new DDC
      initiatives should be based on knowledge of the DDC managers and their
      home institutions, monitoring of the Web, and other information sources.</span></li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>At each regular
     meeting of the TGICA, DDC Managers will provide an overview of DDC
     operations and previously implemented or proposed modifications to the
     DDC.</span></li>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>The TGICA
     provides oversight for the DDC and establishes policies for managing it. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>The TGICA
     establishes a standing “DDC Workgroup” of at least three members. The DDC
     Workgroup will periodically review the websites that make up the DDC and
     provide ongoing feedback to the DDC Managers. More specifically, it will
     review the DDC site before each TGICA meeting and prepare a report for
     discussion by the TGICA on its assessment of the state of the DDC and
     materials or aspects of the site that need to be updated. The DDC Managers
     may request input from the TGICA or workgroups as needed. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>The TGICA
     provides leadership for identifying needs for observations, model data,
     technical guidelines, and other materials in standard formats to
     facilitate research by scientists in diverse settings. It relies on its
     members and the DDC Managers for suggestions and proposals for new
     content.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>The TGICA must
     approve additions of data, scenarios, technical guidelines, and other
     materials to the DDC’s holdings.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt'>Before being
     added to the DDC, materials must be peer reviewed to ensure quality and
     reliability for their intended purpose. Climate data and scenarios must
     meet the requirements established by the TGICA for such data as described at:<b>
     http://www.ipcc-data.org/</b>. IPCC “approved,” “adopted,” “accepted,” and
     “supporting” materials do not require further review as they have already
     been reviewed through processes defined in IPCC’s procedures. The Task
     Group should review other materials (e.g., technical guidelines; climate,
     socio-economic, or environmental data produced with models that have not
     been reviewed through established diagnosis or intercomparison; other
     websites) before deciding to place them (or links to them) on the DDC. At
     least three independent reviews must be obtained. A written record of the
     review process and comments on proposed materials will be maintained as
     part of the record of the meeting at which the TGICA approves adding the
     materials to the DDC. </span></li>
