 <p> The DDC has been established by the IPCC to provide a common and easily accessible set of
 information relating to climate change scenarios for impacts and adaptation assessments.
 As well as providing direct access to GCM data through the <a href="/sim/index.html"
 >DDC GCM Data Archive</a>, the DDC also provides users with access to a variety of other
 scenario information and descriptions of these various datasets and how they can be used in
 scenario construction and impacts assessment.</p>
 
 <p> Users often have questions about what different scenario datasets represent and how they
 can be used in scenario construction and application. We have provided answers to a set of
 the most <a href="/ddc/ddc_faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</a>. Although these answers
 cannot be exhaustive they provide some assistance to users who may be new to climate scenario issues.
 A more structured guide to the DDC scenarios is provided in the <a href="guidelines/index.html">DDC
 Guidelines Section</a>.</p>
 
 <p> Finally, if you have any questions about the DDC, find errors on the site, or have general
 questions about climate scenarios that we can add to our FAQs, then please contact the DDC management
 at: <a href="mailto:support@ceda.ac.uk">support@ceda.ac.uk.</a>
 We will do our best to reply.</p>
